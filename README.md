## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Grid styling is much simpler than I made it out to be last time. 
Previously I didn't want to use a class name on every bit of code in the html, but it actually simplified things going that route. 
I reached a better understanding of media queries and how to get better responsiveness and styling with them. 

### Continued development

Getting more accurate with class names will be helpful in the future, I get concerned about length of the name and end up trying to simplify it all. 
I need to get a better grasp of media queries since I feel they'll be vital in future projects. 

### Useful resources

- [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - This was helpful for styling the bullet points, also using and understanding media queries. You *need* to learn how to ask it questions so you understand your problem and the solution.
